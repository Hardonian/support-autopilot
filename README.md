# support-autopilot
A runnerless support autopilot that ingests tickets + KB docs, performs triage, drafts responses with enforced citations, and proposes KB patches. It outputs JobForge job requests for any heavier processing (index rebuild, batch triage) but does not execute or send messages by default.
